Test Aquarium's Import Feature
---

This workflow contains one operation type, one library, one sample
type, and one container type. It is used to test Aquarium's import and
export functionality. Note that the two containers it defines, Widget
Stock and Widget Aliquot, have an M20 prefix. They will be managed by
your M20 Location Wizard if you have one. If not, add one and make its
b and c capacities equal to 16.
